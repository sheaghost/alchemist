### Overview
A single-file Discord self bot.

### Features
  + Fast.
  + Feature-rich.
  + Constantly developed.

### Library
This was made with [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris). I chose this library because it
has expendable mention caching, easily understood functions, as well as no hassle when used
on a self-bot. On top of all of that, it is well known for being up-to-date, rich
with resources and support, and updated constantly.

### Updates

### Overview
A single-file Discord self bot.

### Features
  + Fast.
  + Feature-rich.
  + Constantly developed.

### Library
This was made with [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris). I chose this library because it
has expendable mention caching, easily understood functions, as well as no hassle when used
on a self-bot. On top of all of that, it is well known for being up-to-date, rich
with resources and support, and updated constantly.

### Updates
To get new updates, join the [server](https://discord.gg).

### Download & Run
Make sure you have the following:
	+ [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
	+ [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
	
When you have your file, direct your command prompt to the file for this self bot.
Upon doing that and having node and such, run **npm i** then the package for all of these:
	+ Eris
	+ moment
	+ ms
